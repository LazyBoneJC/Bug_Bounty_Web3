# My Web3 Security Research Portfolio

## üõ°Ô∏è Introduction

Welcome to my Web3 bug bounty and security research repository. This space is dedicated to documenting my journey into the depths of smart contract security. Here, you will find detailed analyses, proof-of-concept exploits, and vulnerability reports for various protocols. My mission is to help secure the decentralized future by identifying critical vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

This collection represents not just technical findings, but also a commitment to rigorous analysis, clear communication, and continuous learning within the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain security.

## üî¨ My Approach to Security

I believe that robust smart contract security goes beyond surface-level scanning. My approach is rooted in a deep, fundamental understanding of a protocol's architecture and economic design. I focus on:

-   **Logic-First Analysis:** Deconstructing the intricate state machines and internal logic of smart contracts to uncover hidden assumptions and edge cases.
-   **Economic & Incentive Analysis:** Examining how financial primitives can be manipulated and how economic incentives can be misaligned to create attack vectors.
-   **Adversarial Mindset:** Thinking like an attacker to foresee non-obvious paths that could lead to fund loss, protocol insolvency, or deadlocks.
-   **Constructive Reporting:** Providing clear, actionable, and well-documented reports with runnable Proof-of-Concepts to help development teams quickly understand, replicate, and mitigate the identified risks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise

-   **Smart Contract Auditing:** Deep analysis of Solidity code for logic flaws, access control issues, re-entrancy, and other common/uncommon vulnerabilities.
-   **DeFi Security:** Understanding of complex financial protocols, economic exploits, oracle manipulation, and tokenomics.
-   **Testing & Verification:** Proficiency in using Foundry to write comprehensive tests and create isolated, runnable Proof-of-Concept exploits.
-   **Technical Communication:** Authoring detailed, clear, and professional vulnerability reports that are easy for developers to understand and act upon.

## üöÄ My Journey Continues

The world of Web3 security is a marathon, not a sprint. I am constantly learning, researching new attack vectors, and honing my skills. My goal is to continue contributing to the security of the ecosystem, collaborate with top-tier teams, and help build a more resilient decentralized world.
